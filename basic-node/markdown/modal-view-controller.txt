Structuring your code

we want to follow a certain structure when writing web apps

MVC Pattern:

What is MVC?

Its a separate of concerns, different parts of your code does different things

We work with models, views and controllers

Models 

are objects -> representing the Data and working with the Data

* fetch
* save

views

* rendering the right content
* decoupled from app code

Controllers 

Are the connection between the models and the views
The controller is the middle man

How does a route fit into this?
