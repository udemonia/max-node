Stream -> request body 1 -> request body 2 -> request body 3 -> Fully Parsed

data comes in chunks

done so that we can start working on this right away - as data comes in, 
not when its complete

think of large files uploaded; etc.

To work with streamed data you need a buffer:

A buffer is like a bus stop - points in time to interact w/ the streamed

w/ node proper we can do this with event listeners

.on()
